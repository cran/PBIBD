Description: The PBIB designs are important type of incomplete block designs
 having wide area of their applications for example in agricultural
 experiments, in plant breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package
 constructs various series of PBIB designs and assists in checking all the
 necessary conditions of PBIB designs and the association scheme on which
 these designs are based on. It also assists in calculating the efficiencies
 of PBIB designs with any number of associate classes. The package also
 constructs Youden-m square designs which are Row-Column designs for the
 two-way elimination of heterogeneity. The incomplete columns of these
 Youden-m square designs constitute PBIB designs. With the present
 functionality, the package will be of immense importance for the researchers
 as it will help them to construct PBIB designs, to check if their PBIB
 designs and association scheme satisfy various necessary conditions for the
 existence, to calculate the efficiencies of PBIB designs based on any
 association scheme and to construct Youden-m square designs for the two-way
 elimination of heterogeneity. R. C. Bose and K. R. Nair (1939)
